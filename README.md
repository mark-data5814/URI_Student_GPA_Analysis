#### Abstract

Our group decided to take a look at what factors play in college students receiving their GPA. In order to collect data, we created a Google Forms survey and shared it amongst our peers and within our campus organizations. We received a great deal of responses, and with real world data we hope to gain some insight as to what influences students receiving high, or low, GPAs, and other insight into college students as a whole. To do this, we will form different hypotheses, and perform respective analysis approaches to draw conclusions from our data. Our first question of interest is; can we create a classification tree that is able to accurately predict students’ GPA letter grade? Our second question is; can we use GPA and Hours_Work to determine if students are in a study group? And finally, can a multi-class support vector machine accurately predict students’ GPA letter grade?
